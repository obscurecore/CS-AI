### Components

* A graph database that holds terms, atomic formulas, sentence (mathematical logic) and relational model as hypergraphs; giving them a probabilistic truth-value [interpretation, dubbed the AtomSpace.
* A satisfiability modulo theories solver, built in as a part of a generic graph query engine, for performing graph and hypergraph pattern matching (graph isomorphism).
* An implementation of a probabilistic reasoning engine based on probabilistic logic networks (PLN).
* A probabilistic genetic programming called Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search, or [MOSES](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/MOSES) originally developed by Moshe Looks who is now employed at Google.
* An attention allocation system based on economic theory, [ECAN.](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/ECAN)
* An embodiment system for interaction and learning within virtual worlds based in part on OpenPsi and Unity (game engine).
* A natural language input system consisting of Link Grammar and [RelEx](http://opencog.org/wiki/RelEx) both of which employ AtomSpace-like representations for semantic and syntactic relations.
* A natural language generation system called [SegSim](http://opencog.org/wiki/SegSim) with implementations [NLGen](https://launchpad.net/nlgen)
* An implementation of Psi-Theory for handling emotional states, drives and urges, dubbed [OpenPsi](http://opencog.org/wiki/OpenPsi)
* Interfaces to Hanson Robotics robots, including [emotion modelling](http://wiki.hansonrobotics.com/w/Emotion_modeling) via OpenPsi.
